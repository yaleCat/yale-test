## Multi-Class Classification

As for classification task, the annotation strageties are really depends on what kind of issue you want solve. We list down some most common ways for building annotation task:

* Easiest way to create annotation task. After we get a baseline dataset with detection box, we just need to create 'Cleaning task' for each concept.

### Cleaning task for confused images based on entropy


### Cleaning task for adding data based on keywords search

### Group cleaing task for badcase driven data coverage expansion based on visual search 
(be careful of overfitting)
